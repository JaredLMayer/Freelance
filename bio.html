            <p>Growing up in a family of musicians, made it inevitable that I would start a career in the music industry. I graduated from Berklee College of Music with a Bachelor’s DEGREE IN Contemporary Writing and Music Production. Musically, I grew up in the 50’s, 60’s, and 70’s. I didn’t start really listening to music of my generation until my mid-late teens. The blues is in my blood, while “original” R&B is in my soul. While my friends were listening to contemporary artists and other mainstream pop artists, my walkman cd player was spinning one of my favorite compilation albums, “Atlantic Rhythm And Blues 1947-1974.” Sound waves from Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, Joe Tex, Aretha Franklin, and Eddie Floyd were flowing into my ears, and embedded in my brain. I could hear that Muscle Shoals studio band from a mile away. My friends would look at me like I was from another world. Being fed music from arguably the greatest time in recording history, I didn’t understand how people listened could only listen to contemporary “Top 40’s.”
I grew up in recording studios, tagging along with my father who would do session after session, and gig after gig. I was unconsciously growing an understanding for recording, production, and overall musicality.</p>
            <p>When I was 6 years old, my father picked me up from school and took me to my first piano lesson and took to it very quickly. I became classically trained in piano and after many years of playing pieces from Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Chopin, and Tchaikovsky, I wanted to play Jazz and Blues. My teacher, a traditional pianist, who only knew one style, forbid me to play anything but classical music, as she thought it would inhibit me from growing as a pianist. I became frustrated with her and her methods and asked my father to not take me back for lessons.
                At age 8, I picked up the clarinet and quickly rose to first chair in the school band.</p>
             <img id="bio2" class="img-responsive" SRC="photos/mitch-bio2.jpg" >
            <p>A family friend who noticed my ability on the clarinet, suggested that I also pick up the saxophone. He said the transition would be seamless and I would really enjoy it for playing Jazz. He was right. I loved the saxophone and I loved playing along to Charlie Parker records and reading my favorite saxophone book, “The Charlie Parker Omnibook,” which was a transcription of every solo he recorded. It was amazing how similar his “be-bop” based solos were. After all, every artist has their own sound.
During high school, I got heavily involved in music production and being a producer. I would sit in the studio for days at a time writing tracks and songs. I would listen to my favorite songs and try to emulate their sound, thus growing my understanding for contemporary production.
Production takes you on journeys, each of which open up new doors and possibilities.</p>
            <p>Today, I work with all styles of music. I always look for unique and different sounds. Every project I work on presents new challenges and requires its very own distinct sound. One of the greatest lessons I had to learn about production was to never forget about the musicality of the work.</p>
